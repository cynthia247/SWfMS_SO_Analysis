45015116,Apache Airflow Continous Integration Workflow and Dependency management,"I'm thinking of starting to use Apache Airflow for a project and am wondering how people manage continuous integration and dependencies with airflow. More specifically
Say I have the following set up

3 Airflow servers: dev staging and production.

I have two python DAG'S whose source code I want to keep in seperate repos.
The DAG's themselves are simple, basically just use a Python operator to call main(*args, **kwargs). However the actually code that's run by main is very large and stretches several files/modules.
Each python code base has different dependencies
for example,

Dag1 uses Python2.7 pandas==0.18.1, requests=2.13.0

Dag2 uses Python3.6 pandas==0.20.0 and Numba==0.27 as well as some cythonized code that needs to be compiled

How do I manage Airflow running these two Dag's with completely different dependencies?
Also, how do I manage the continuous integration of the code for both these Dags into each different Airflow enivornment (dev, staging, Prod)(do I just get jenkins or something to ssh to the airflow server and do something like git pull origin BRANCH)

Hopefully this question isn't too vague and people see the problems i'm having.

48986732,Airflow: Creating a DAG in airflow via UI,"Airflow veterans please help,

I was looking for a cron replacement and came across apache airflow.

We have a setup where multiple users should be able to create their own DAGs and schedule their jobs. 

Our users are a mix of people who may not know how to write the DAG python file. Also, they may not have access to the server where airflow is running.

Is it possible to create an airflow DAG via UI. I could not find any reference to the same. All examples speak about creating a python file and uploading it to the $AIRFLOW_HOME/dag/ directory. Users will not have access to this directory.

Rundeck for example allows user to add workflows and task dependencies via UI. Is there a plugin/functionality similar to this in airflow.

PS: I really like the way airflow shows the dependency graphs and want to try it out. But If creating a DAG is so complicated, then it will be a major problem for lots of my end users.

56707707,How to enable SSL on Airflow Webserver?,"I've been trying to enable HTTPS via SSL on my Apache Airflow frontend but the documentation is quite sparse and there aren't that many good examples on this online.

My instance of Airflow is currently running on a Red Hat Linux VM. I've tried generating a key/certificate, and pointing the configuration file to the respective paths, but it does not seem to work.

From the Airflow documentation, it seems like we are supposed to simply generate a path to the cert and key &amp; add a path to the SSL cert &amp; key in Airflow. I generated a .key and .csr file using Open SSL.

/usr/bin/openssl genrsa -rand /dev/urandom -out /etc/httpd/conf/server.key 2048

/usr/bin/openssl req -new -key /etc/httpd/conf/server.key -out /etc/httpd/conf/server.csr



I then updated the configuration file...

# Paths to the SSL certificate and key for the web server. When both are
# provided SSL will be enabled. This does not change the web server port.
web_server_ssl_cert = /etc/httpd/conf/server.csr
web_server_ssl_key = /etc/httpd/conf/server.key



I then reboot the webserver, and get the following error on the web page:

Forbidden

'[SSL] PEM lib (_ssl.c:3337)'


If anyone has any experience or pointers as to how they enabled SSL on their Airflow instance, I'd really appreciate it! I'm at a bit of a dead end right now and it doesn't seem like anyone else online has gotten a satisfactory answer.

76099211,Copy parquet from S3 to Redshift Fail: Unreachable Invalid type: 4000,"I am now trying to load all tables from my AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) to Amazon Redshift.
Not so important here though, I use Apache Airflow to do all the operations for me. The jobs detail is like:

Export all the tables in RDS, convert them to parquet files and upload them to S3
Extract the tables' schema from Pandas Dataframe to Apache Parquet format
Upload the Parquet files in S3 to Redshift

For many weeks it works just fine with the Redshift COPY command like this:
TRUNCATE {table};\n\
COPY {table}\n\
FROM '{s3_key}'\n\
IAM_ROLE '{os.getenv('REDSHIFT_IAM_ROLE')}'\n\
FORMAT AS PARQUET\n\

I have tried to find the logs by query id in the above error message in Redshift by running the command:

But even cannot locate the detail of the error anywhere.
Have searched around and asked ChatGPT but I didn't find any similar issues or directions to even find more about the error logs. Only found some issues saying that this may be kinda Redshift Internal Errors.
But for the parquet format and data type, conversion was totally fine. Could anyone please point out or give some suggestions for me to fix my data pipeline issue?
