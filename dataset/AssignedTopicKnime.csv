Spain    Rock   10

Essentially, Tag entries (unique ones) become the columns and countries (unique ones) become the row id's with the weight values sticking with their country/tag.

I've tried everything I can think of in Knime and no raw SQL query springs to mind.  In Knime, I successfully created the structure of the matrix I want (Country x Tag), but I have no idea how to populate the actual Weight values, they're all question marks.  My working solution is to simply output the data into a CSV file in the form I want instead of into the database.  But that's klunky and annoying to keep in sync.  Any ideas?

I am trying to integrate my code into KNIME workflow using JavaSnippet. I have exported the code into a jar and put it into the KNIME jre/lib/endorsed folder. The code references CDK 1.4.19 and I have also placed the corresponding jar file into the same directory. I do not have CDK node extensions installed in KNIME and using them is also not an option in my case.

The code starts with:

IChemObjectBuilder builder = SilentChemObjectBuilder.getInstance();

SmilesParser sp= new SmilesParser(builder);


When I try to execute JavaSnippet I get the following exception message:

Evaluation of java snippet failed for row ""Row0"". Exception message: Could not initialize class org.openscience.cdk.smiles.SmilesParser


When I just try

IChemObjectBuilder builder = SilentChemObjectBuilder.getInstance();


It works and I get no exception message. I have checked, the builder is not a null. However, when I try to initialize SmilesParser, it fails. This class is public. It has no default constructor and has one public constructor that takes IChemObjectBuilder as a parameter.

I have tried to use class loader:

URL[] classLoaderUrls = new URL[]{new URL(""file:///path on my computer/knime_2.9.4/jre/lib/endorsed/cdk-1.4.19.jar"")};

URLClassLoader urlClassLoader = new URLClassLoader(classLoaderUrls);

Constructor&lt;?&gt; constructor = parserClass.getConstructor(classParameters); //until this line there are no problems

Object parser = constructor.newInstance(builder);   //fails here with the same exception message: Could not initialize class org.openscience.cdk.smiles.SmilesParser


I am sure that this is not a CDK error because I can execute the code in Eclipse.

Why can a constructor of one class be called from KNIME without any problems and a constructor of another class can not??

I would be very grateful if you could suggest a solution or a probable reason why this happens.

According to a thread on the KNIME forums, a similar problem also occurs with the community extension ""Matlab Snippet"", which builds on the same matlabcontrol framework I use (which is also the one mentioned in the error).

I tried evading the problem by including the matlabcontrol as a package in my project (it's open source, so I could just import the sources), then the same error appeared and mentioned the package .jar created by the OSGI system (in my case, matlab.jar, which is the name I chose in my build.properties), so I assume it was just the first one alphabetically and all of the files in the OSGI bundle folder are affected by this problem.

What confuses me is that the problem only occurs once I try to execute the node and connect to MATLAB. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't seem to have been resolved in the KNIME forum thread linked above, apparently an older version of that extension didn't have the issue and users just installed the old version.

So, can I somehow make the URL correctly convert to URI? Is the Protection Domain the cause and can I change it? Does it have anything to do with the default Class Loader?



I have now installed the plugin via a feature in a folder (see comments). The error persists, but the path changed:

13,34142095,Troubleshooting Reoccurring OutOfMemory PermGen Space Error,"I have been helping a friend develop nodes in Knime. For those who don't know Knime is essentially a framework in Java that creates nodes that automate some ""thing"" you program them to do. Each node has 4-5 classes, and the workflows we are creating have sometimes 50-60 nodes. 

I have been researching about PermGen and to my knowledge it is essentially a copy of the compiled form of each class/function for the program to use on runtime. If you have a large number of classes (which we do) then PermGen will run out of memory. Each time I set up a flow my Eclipse crashes, so I thought by decreasing the number of classes I could get it to run again, but now the same flows that were running a week ago are still getting PermGen Errors. I have looked into how to handle the problem but I am not sure which avenue to take and why. 

All changes are for eclipse.ini

Adding PermGenSpace:

-XX:MaxPermSize=1024m


CMSClassUnloadingEnabled:

-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled


CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled:

-XX:MaxPermSize=128m 
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC 
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled


I understand the change of setting MaxPermSize and how it solves the problem and I can't see any negative effects, but I don't understand if the two other changes could effect my setup negatively. 

How should I be approaching this problem?

15,35344070,Java SIGSEGV in KNIME running on cluster (SGE),"I am trying to run KNIME 2.11.3 software on Scientific Linux cluster (with Sun Grid Engine) using qsub, asking for 4GB of ram.

Java used:

java version ""1.8.0_73""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)


The problem:
The KNIME software starts up the workflow properly, but (probably) during loading up of Weka machine learning nodes the software crashes. The error information I get is as follows:

    #
    # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:

    # Problematic frame:

What could be happening ? (Here is from the log)

FINAL EDIT, FOUND ANSWER:

The answer was to ask the cluster for more RAM, I asked for 8GB RAM minimum using ""-l h_vmem=8G"" while doing qsub. It is awkward as the same workflow works properly on my old laptop with 4GB RAM but creates such a nasty error elsewhere. It is also possible this is our local cluster configuration-related error. 
",1,-1,-1.0,"I am trying to run KNIME 2.11.3 software on Scientific Linux cluster (with Sun Grid Engine) using qsub, asking for 4GB of ram.

Java used:

java version ""1.8.0_73""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)


The problem:
The KNIME software starts up the workflow properly, but (probably) during loading up of Weka machine learning nodes the software crashes. The error information I get is as follows:

    #
    # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
    #
    #  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00002b2774bf2c4c, pid=115080, tid=47451179185920

What could be happening ? (Here is from the log)

20,40003509,regexReplace in String Manipulation KNIME,"I'm trying to remove the content of all cells that start with a character that is not a number using KNIME (v3.2.1). I have different ideas but nothing works.

The cells contain multiple lines, however only the first line is removed by this approach. 

2) String Manipulation Node: regexMatcher($casrn_new$,""^[^0-9].*"") followed by Rule Engine Node to remove all columns that are ""TRUE"". 

The regexMatcher gives me ""False"" even for columns that should be ""True"" though. 

3) String Replacer Node: I inserted the expression ^[^0-9].* into the Pattern column and selected ""Replace whole String"" but the regex is not recognised by that node so nothing gets replaced.

Does anyone have a solution for any of those approaches or knows another Node that might do the job? Help is much appreciated!

Anyway, 
One of the threads of a similar topic recommended to scale the values by a large enough number (a scalar)!

I found similar topics to this one but none of them is covering how to chose the scalar to scale values with

Anyway, 
One of the threads of a similar topic recommended to scale the values by a large enough number (a scalar)!

I understand the first lines are just a warning? and it shouldn't be the cause of this error, maybe I'm wrong. What comes before the R snippet node is basic Database connection with a few Database SQL Executors and data manipulation nodes. Perhaps the error is within the code I provided or maybe I should look into earlier nodes?

Since I'm very new to R language I couldnt find a solution on web anywhere.

48,61703189,"Bridging Knime, Keras and DL4J – Exceptions when loading h5 model","I’m working on a project which needs to train a DNN and then run the trained model in a Java environment. As the training data requires a lot of manipulation I’ve used Knime and its Keras libraries to do most of the work, and I’m exported the trained model to a Keras h5 file which can be loaded into DL4J (I’m using Knime Keras Integration 4.1.0v201911171432 and DL4J 1.0.0-beta6).

The modelling is ongoing, but for a POC I’ve created a network by chaining the following nodes:


Keras Input Layer (shape 144)
Keras Dense Layer (units 500)
Keras Dense Layer (units 500)
Keras Dense Layer (units 1)
Keras Set Output Layers (single output shape [1] pointing to the last layer)


This then gets trained and outputted with a “Keras Network Writer” node which writes a .h5 file.

In Java I have includes the following dependencies:

 &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.deeplearning4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;deeplearning4j-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0.0-beta6&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.nd4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;nd4j-native-platform&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0.0-beta6&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;


And run the following code:

import org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.KerasModelImport;
…
ComputationGraph model = KerasModelImport.importKerasModelAndWeights(""2x2x2keras.h5"");


Which returns the following exception

As this is the first time I’ve tried using Knime to manage my dataflow, I can’t be certain if the issues is with the file (being created in Knime) or the code loading it (into DL4J+Java). I’m assuming the comment about setOutput is intended for when you are creating the network with a python script, but can’t see anyway to set allowNoOutputs when KerasModelImport only has static methods.

52,72691259,Memory footprint of KNIME is growing until the machine freezes,"Love KNIME and what it can do to standardise/simplify ML, but I’ve a new set of problems that are driving me crazy. I’m running ML analysis of tables of data with ~400 columns/400 rows. Non-trivial certainly, but not huge. I’ve a simple workflow that currently just evaluates each column, one at a time, as a feature, so no combinatorics.
I’m using a respectable linux machine with 16GB RAM. KNIME starts the analysis taking 10% of the RAM (according to Htop) and just grows and grows 0.1% at a time until eventually KNIME has consumed 78% of RAM and the whole of the RAM is full between KNIME and OS. Then the swap memory starts filling up. Once that reaches 100%,the machine then freezes.
I’ve tried adjusting Xmx in knime.ini and it has no effect whatsoever and I’ve added the heavy garbage collector node to my loop also to no effect.
Can anyone offer any help? Getting a bit desperate here! I’m running knime v4.6.
Thanks
Steve.
