So I'm wondering if it is possible that the application in PHP communicates with RapidMiner to process the data and show the results provided by RapidMiner in the interface.

I know RapidMiner is implemented in Java, and there is the option of using Java bridge to comunicate PHP and JAVA, but I'm not sure if that is a solution to this.

I have noticed no matter what type of extensions we use for getting  export (i.e. .pdf, .ps .jpg , etc), the export engine do like a screenshot of the current view instead of the whole output space, this has caused lots of issues for me exporting gigantic decision trees of my research.

I then used the ""Data to Documents"" operator and the ""Process Documents"" operator (token, stopword, stem, case, etc.) to process the data. However, when I tried to port the data to ""Naive Bayes"" operator, an error msg told me that the data is not labelled and asked me to use ""Set Role"" operator.

I have already built a working text analyser, but I'm stuck at the web crawling part. The problem is that the web crawler does crawl through the requested sites, but doesn't store them. I have tried experimenting with page size, depth and the like, but still the program just skips those sites. It is probable that the problem is with my storing rules. They look like the following, when trying to crawl through Kickstarter's sites:

Follow with matching URL:

.+kickstarter.+

Store with matching URL:

https://www\.kickstarter\.com\/projects.+

http://www\.kickstarter\.com\/projects.+

(?i)http.*://www\.kickstarter\.com\/projects.+


An example URL that would need to be stored is:

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/corvuse/bhaloidam-an-indie-tabletop-storytelling-game?ref=spotlight


(no advertising intended)

And the log looks like the following:

As you can see, it follows through with the process and just skips these links, and it doesn't even say that it doesn't match the filter rules so it's been discarded, so I'm not even sure that in these cases the program compares the links to the rules. I see a lot of links in the log preceded with (""Following link.."") but very few preceded with (""Discarded page...""). Does this mean that it just checks a few pages, or just that it won't notify me for every discarded page? I am able to save these projects' sites manually, but understandibly, I wouldn't like to do this with hundreds of sites.

I've also built a model for Indiegogo, and the same model works if I use only the third storing rule (and remove the first two). So I thought this is also the problem with my Kickstarter model, but no luck this way either.

Thanks in advance!

21853989,How to apply InformationGain in rapidminer with seperate test set ?,"I am dealing with text classification in rapidminer. I have seperate test and training splits. I applied Information Gain to a dataset using n-fold cross validation but i am confused on how to apply it on seperate test set ? Below is attached image 

In figure i have connected the word list output from first ""Process Documents From Files"" which is used for training to second ""Processed Documents From Files"" which is used for testing but i want to apply the reduced feature to the second ""Process Documents From Files"" which perhaps should be the one returned from ""Select By Weight"" (reduced dimensions) operator but it returns weights which i cannot provide to second ""Process Documents From Files"". I searched alot but did'nt managed to find anything which can satisfy my need ?

Is it really possible for Rapidminer to have seperate test/train splits and apply feature selection ?

Is there any way to convert these weights into word list ? Please don't say write in repository (i can't do this) ?

In such scenario when i have different test/train splits and needs to apply feature selection, how would i make sure that test/train splits have same dimension vectors ?

I am really trapped out at it, kindly help ...

I have been spending a lot of my time trying to figure something out by studying the initialization for each algorithm each tools since the interface is different and there are some parameter that is on RapidMiner but not in Weka or otherwise, so I am a bit confused. (is it the problem?)

Despite that what do you think is wrong? is there some initialization  process that I missed? or is it because the code is different in each tools even they use the same algorithm?

25347624,RapidMiner: How can I efficiently generate n-grams?,"For my thesis, I'm trying to perform sentiment analysis on larger (up to 2GB) files of text documents (product reviews) using RapidMiner Community Edition with the Text Mining extension.

I'd like to generate bigrams for that. But for a small 70MB csv file with not even 100.000 documents the generation of bigrams already takes 12 hours on an eight-core 32GB RAM machine (with RapidMiner configured to use 28GB and all cores). 

I've been able to reduce it to 3 hours using filters with the downside of having bigrams, which do not exist in the original documents. I'm not sure, if this is as far as I can get. 

My current process looks like this:

Read CSV -> Process documents (Tokenize -> Stem -> Filter stop words -> Filter length &lt; 2 -> Generate n-grams ) -> Split Validation

Removing the n-gram operator drops precision and recall down to ~60%, which is far from being acceptable. Thanks for any ideas, how to speed this up.

38382281,What method does rapidminer use to calculate correlation matrix and why am I getting negative correlations for two categorical/nominal attributes?,"I am hoping someone can answer this for me as I am stuck.  

What methodology does rapidminer use in it's correlation matrix? For all data combinations would be nice, but most importantly for nominal/categorical data sets?

I am using rapidminer to build a correlation matrix and have been careful to properly label all attributes as numbers, binominal, polynominal, etc.  I am finding that my matrix shows negative correlations for some of the nominal/nominal combinations of attributes, which doesn't make since based on the methods that I would normally think would be chosen (Phi, Cramer's V, Contingency Coefficient) to calculate this.  I thought the correlation had to be positive for these tests, and it doesn't make sense to have a ""negative"" correlation between categories like gender and city as that would suggest an order in the data.

Is there another test used, or dummy coding or something?  And if dummy coding is used how reliable is the value obtained?  

Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me.  Hate to admit when I am lost, but here I am needing a map :)

[Edit: i'm using the ""Read CSV"" function]
do i need to increase the internal precision of rapidminer and how do i do this?
I already increased the display of rapidminer.general.fractiondigits.numbers which gives me a lot if trailing zeros e.g. 8.000562E-3 -> 0.008000562000000000 but still if the exponent is -9 or smaller it will only show 8.000562E-9 -> 0.

EDIT: i checked ""read CSV"", the numbers should be imported as ""double_array"". the machiene epsilon for double is about 1E-16. the behaviour i encounter looks like its treated as a single precision, which has an eps about 1E-9.Am i missing something?

This is what I have in XPATH:

So I added a /text() to the end and still nothing. I have played around with adding //div instead of //* and have used h:/span also. I'm kind of hoping there's a special syntax for retrieving quotes that i'm unaware of?

I had 5 of the 14 columns with date values in dd.MM.yyyy format.

Problem 1
I am trying to import the file. In ""Format your colums"" step, if I choose the type of that colums as ""date"", it gives errors and all cells in columns turns ""?""

So I selected ""polynomial"" and planed to convert attribute type to date later.

Problem 2 (the real one)
I imported the data and put ""nominal to date"" operator. When I run I got error in line 14.899:

Cannot parse date: Unparseable date: ""0""


I find the line and I see that columns separated wrong. There was a tab character in a string in the a prior cell. So values moved one cell right. And this row was not the only one that moved.

I want to split the rows that has the values in wrong data type for spesified attributes. So I cant correct them manually.

How can I do that in Rapidminer?

Or any other ideas to figure theese problems out?

The quick connection test to the Hadoop is completed successfully.
when I run the rapidminer process, it's finished by an error: 

Process failed before getting into running state. this indicates that an error occurred during submitting or starting the spark job or writing the process output or the exception to the disc. Please check the logs of the spark job on the YARN Resource Manager interface for more information about the error.


in localhost:8088 I have this diagnostics informations enter image description here 

this is the scheduler of the job enter image description here

I'm new with Hadoop and spark and I can't configure the memory in an efficient manner.

59376928,is there a specific way to write xpaths into rapidminer for web crawling,"I have tried so many options, over many days to try and extract data. I don't know where I am going wrong.
for example, I am on the website reviewcentre.com and am looking at car selling site reviews.
I am struggling badly to retrieve information, most of my xpaths appear incorrect.
Where can I best learn how to do this properly, I have spent days at this.

https://www.reviewcentre.com/car_dealers/we_buy_any_car_-_wwwwebuyanycarcom-review_14068020

I know how to copy xpaths, but when it comes to rapidminer, I can't extract the data.
I know I am doing it wrong, but I don't know what's right unfortunately.

examples include

//*[@id=""ReviewTitle-14068020""]
h:html/h:head/h:title/text() 
this one works!
//*[@id=""ReviewBox-14068020""]/div[1]/div[2]/p[2]/span


I have no problem it appears retrieving the xpath from the website, but using it for extracting data on rapidminer is not working at all..Would really appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction.

without providing any other insight nor referencing a line within my code in the script. I have updated the numpy library in case it was a compatibility problem with older versions but still no solution.

Also, when checking if the python environment is ok (Anaconda env), from the Settings>Preferences>Python Scripting in RapidMiner, all tests pass with success.

The processor xml from the .rmp file is:

  &lt;/operator&gt;


Up to now, I have tried:
1. Update the initial DataFrame (data) with my computed columns and return it.
2. Create a new DataFrame with my columns and return that either alone or as second argument after data.
3. Create a method (within the script) that accepts the initial DataFrame data as argument, modified it, and then return it.
4. Pickle the new DataFrame, save it, load it and return it.
All these tries resulted in the same error presented above.

My guessing is that RapidMiner makes some kind of check upon the processor's completion that uses the code which produces the error above, so it fails and the processor terminates.

Is there a special proper way to handle and return DataFrames in RapidMiner to bypass the error, or is there anything else I could examine for finding out where the problem lies?

57455044,How K-NN Algorithms work with same distance in rapidminer?,"Actually I already asked in rapidminer forum, but no one has given an answer yet..
https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/55963/how-k-nn-algorithms-work-with-same-distance-in-rapidminer#latest

I can't find a satisfying answer for KNN-algorithm with same euclidean distance in rapidminer..

I found a similar question, but it's not in rapidminer
K Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm

say k=5. Now I try to classify an unknown object by getting its 5 nearest neighbours.
What to do, if distance is a lot of the same distance..
if after determining the 4 nearest neighbors, the next 2 (or more) nearest objects have the same distance and diferent label? Which object of these 2 or more rapidminer chosen as the 5th nearest neighbor?

I confused.. I try in excel, and the result is diferent with rapidminer for some data.
in excel the result label is ""LU"":
https://i.ibb.co/RSYnTWg/Capturess.jpg

but the result in rapidminer is ""LT"" :
https://i.ibb.co/NKv0bmp/4.jpg

result rapidminer weighted vote is checked is ""LU"" :
https://i.ibb.co/r68y05v/5.jpg

How rapidminer work with case like that...
how rapidminer sorting the distance ?...
something wrong with my data ?, or rapidminer sorting random if distance is same ?

For the web service I use a Read CSV to read the file that the user passes me in the POST.

The web service is configured to receive a UTF-8 text/xml

I tried to invoke it from cmd with Curl by upload-files and it correctly returned the result in XML format.

So when I make the call with JS from my firebase I try to send a CSV but always without response from the server.

61711012,Problems with instalation of Rapidminer Studio (version 9.6) due to Java,"I'm trying to install RapidMiner Studio and I'm having problems related with Java, running the installation file RapidMiner-Studio.sh in my terminal (OS Ubuntu 18.04). I think I have all the requirements to install RapidMiner. I found out I had to have Java 8 or OpenJDK 8, so I installed and configured as explained here. Also, from the same source's suggestions, I added this in the .sh file: --add-modules=java.xml.bind (after eval \""$JAVA\""). Like this:

if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
eval \""$JAVA\"" --add-modules=java.xml.bind $JVM_OPTIONS -cp \""${rmClasspath}\"" com.rapidminer.launcher.GUILauncher \""$@\""
else
eval \""$JAVA\"" --add-modules=java.xml.bind $JVM_OPTIONS -cp \""${rmClasspath}\"" com.rapidminer.launcher.GUILauncher
fi


My OpenJDK version is this:

openjdk version ""1.8.0_252""
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_252-8u252-b09-1~18.04-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.252-b09, mixed mode)


So, the errors I got from the installation file (after doing chmod +x RapidMiner-Studio.sh and ./RapidMiner-Studio.sh) are the following:

Error: Could not find or load main class com.rapidminer.launcher.JVMOptionBuilder
Unrecognized option: --add-modules=java.xml.bind
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.


It's clear it doesn't recognize the added module java.xml.bind.

So without that added module in the .sh file, I removed it. And running, I got the following errors:

Error: Could not find or load main class com.rapidminer.launcher.JVMOptionBuilder
Error: Could not find or load main class com.rapidminer.launcher.GUILauncher


How can I solve this Java problem?
