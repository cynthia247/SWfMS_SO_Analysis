"Hello,
Once I fix the errors on a specific tool after a workflow fails and execute the tool again, I do not see the option to replace the dataset and resume the workflow with the right dependencies (Resume dependencies from this job). I see the option available on the usegalaxy.eu 1 server but my local installation does not give me that option (I do not see a section for “Additional Options”.)
I have checked the replies on posts like these
Job fail in one element of the list stops the whole pipelin
Is it because of the difference in Galaxy versions? (local installation is 22.05) or do I have to activate it in the config files?

Thanks",-1
"Hi all!

I have two things, one, I can’t get Seurat to work despite inputting the correct files (or at least I think I’m putting it in correctly). Additionally, I have gene names that I would prefer to have in my ‘feature’ files but it just giving me the accession (further into the workflow) as it’s in the first column.

"Hello everyone,

I’m currently in the process of performing DEGS idenitification with DESEQ2 in the galaxy pipeline.

I performed all my steps with Galaxy.

I performed whole RNA transcriptome sequencing. The obtained FASTq files I imported into galaxy and then I performed the following steps:

FASTP
FASTQC
HISAT2
STRINGTIE

And I try DESeq2. But few minits later,I got error meassage.I checked “Tool Standard Error” and it says :
estimating size factors
estimating dispersions
Error in checkForExperimentalReplicates(object, modelMatrix) :

The design matrix has the same number of samples and coefficients to fit,
so estimation of dispersion is not possible. Treating samples
as replicates was deprecated in v1.20 and no longer supported since v1.22.

Calls: DESeq … estimateDispersions → .local → checkForExperimentalReplicates

Please give some advices,help me.",-1
"Welcome, @Vijina_Chakkyarath

There is much prior troubleshooting for errors with these tools at this forum.

You can search with keywords like tool names and datatypes, or click on the tags I added.

You’ll find links to tutorials with examples, plus common solutions that have worked for others.

Please give that a review, compare your data to the data others have shared, and follow up here if you still have a specific question. We’ll need more information to help, and you’ll see that in the other topics, or can review here: Troubleshooting errors 4

Let’s start there. Learning how to ask questions with context will be a useful skill, too :slight_smile:",1
